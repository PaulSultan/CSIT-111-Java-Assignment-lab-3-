This java lab contains two programs in which deals with similar topics the first being Account.java which contains a definition for a simple bank account class with methods to withdraw, deposit, get the balance and account number, and return a String representation. The Second program utilizes the same features in the way of a simple bank account however, this imposes an opening and closing methods in which will allow the user to open a bank account as well as closing an account. The same methods from before are within this program (withdrawing, depositing, and getting account balance). The test program prompts for and reads in three names and creates an account with an initial balance of $ 100 for each. Print the three accounts, then close the first account and try to consolidate the second and third into a new account. Now print the accounts again, including the consolidated one if it was created.
